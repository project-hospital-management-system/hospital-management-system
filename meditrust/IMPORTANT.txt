1) Delete or rename any old folder:
   C:\xampp\htdocs\meditrust
   to
   C:\xampp\htdocs\meditrust_old

2) Extract this zip so you get:
   C:\xampp\htdocs\meditrust\public\index.php

3) Run:
   http://localhost/meditrust/public/

This project DOES NOT use Router.php. If you still see Router.php errors, you are running old files.
